# Charms

`charms` is a library, CLI tool and web explorer for programmable tokens and NFTs on top of Bitcoin. 

_Charms_ are bundles of tokens, NFTs and arbitrary app state, enchanting Bitcoin UTXOs, that can be used to **create apps** on the Bitcoin blockchain.

For example, with Charms, NFTs have state, and it's easy to create a token controlled by an NFT: the token's total supply is stored in the NFT state, and you can only mint the token when updating the NFT state accordingly **in the same transaction**.

Charms are created using _spells_ — special messages added to Bitcoin transactions, manifesting creation and **transformation** of charms.

## Inspiration

Charms are inspired by [Runes](https://docs.ordinals.com/runes.html) — a way to create tokens on top of Bitcoin. Charms are, in a way, a generalization of Runes. 
The main difference is that charms are easily programmable (and composable).
