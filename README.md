# Charms

`charms` is a library, CLI tool and web explorer for programmable tokens and NFTs on top of Bitcoin. 

_Charms_ are bundles of tokens, NFTs and arbitrary app state, enchanting Bitcoin UTXOs, that can be used to **create apps** on the Bitcoin blockchain.

Charms are created using _spells_ — special messages added to Bitcoin transactions, manifesting creation and transformation of charms.

## Inspiration

_Charms_ are inspired by [Runes](https://docs.ordinals.com/runes.html) — a way to create tokens on top of Bitcoin. Charms are a more general concept, that can include NFTs, and arbitrary app state, and can be used to **create apps** on the Bitcoin blockchain. 

The main difference is that charms are easily **programmable**, and can be used to create apps.
